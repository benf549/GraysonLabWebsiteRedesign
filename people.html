				<h3>Naboneeta Sarkar, PhD</h3>
				<div class="personal-blurb-container">
					<p>I joined Grayson Lab at Johns Hopkins BME in January 2021 as a postdoctoral research fellow.
						Prior to that, I have received my Ph.D. from Washington State University with a primary research
						interest in drug delivery from 3D printed bone grafts for enhanced osteogenesis and osteosarcoma
						prevention. Utilizing my expertise in drug delivery and 3D printing, here at Johns Hopkins I am
						trying to develop a patient-specific 3D printed bone tissue engineering scaffolds that can
						generate oxygen upon implantation to facilitate blood vessel formation and early bone
						regeneration in complex craniofacial defects. I am originally from India, where I completed my
						undergraduate studies in Pharmacy. After receiving my B.Pharm from India, I moved to South Korea
						to pursue my M.S. degree. Apart from research work, I love traveling, hiking and everything
						outdoors. When at home, I love binging on true crime documentaries and trying new Indian as well
						as Korean food recipes.</p>

						craniofacial bone defects in a clinical setting. I have the experience of working on
						pre-clinical
						studies involving large animal models in collaboration with clinicians, veterinarians,
						radiographers, pathologists, morphometrists, etc. I have a passion for teaching and have been
						instructing the course “Tissue Engineering - From Hype to Reality” to freshmen for four years in
						a
						row. When I am not synthesizing polymers or 3D printing implants, I like to run, go for a hike,
						visit museums, and try out new restaurants. Always happy to help, learn and collaborate. Please
