		<h3>Stem Cell Biology</h3>
		<div class="research-topic">
			<p>Roughly 40% of all traumatic injuries involve skeletal muscle damage. When volumetric muscle loss occurs
				- i.e. more than 20% of the skeletal muscle tissue volume is lost - spontaneous regeneration fails. We
				use electrospinning technology to develop biomimetic scaffolds that mimic the structure and mechanics of
				native muscles. These biodegradable materials may be used to guide cellular assembly and implant the
				engineered tissues into pre-clinical models of muscle loss. </p>
			<p><i>Scaffold development:</i> We fabricate scaffolds with tunable properties that
				closely mimic the complex
				architecture and mechanics of native skeletal muscle. We combine these with various cell types including
				hiPSCs, ASCs, myoblasts, satellite cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells to engineer vascularized
				skeletal
				muscles. The grafts are used to study in vitro myogenesis and in vivo muscle regeneration.</p>
			<p><i>Computational modeling:</i> We combine theoretical models with in vitro experimentation to further
				understand
				the
				complex nature of myogenesis. Our collaborative works have explored how the mechanical characteristics
				of
				the scaffolds could be described using a model of poroelasticity. We are interested in using
				mathematical
				models to predict how the mechanical properties of the scaffolds guide the expression of myogenic
				regulatory
				factors and tissue formation.</p>
			<p><i>Pre-clinical models:</i> Our team has developed several pre-clinical models for assessing muscle
				regeneration
				following volumetric muscle loss (VML). These include partial resection of the mouse tibialis anterior
				muscle to study muscle regeneration along with host vascular, neural, and cellular infiltration. We have
				also studied more extreme muscle damage, where complete muscles are removed from the mouse hindlimb
				before
				scaffold implantation. On-going studies are investigating scale-up to larger defects of clinically
				relevant
				sizes.</p>

		<h3>Bioreactor Technology</h3>
		<div class="research-topic">
			<p>3D culture techniques endow us with the ability to engineer large, functional grafts for application in
				tissue repair and regeneration. Strategies for developing these tissue constructs rely on growing stem
				cells
				within biomaterial scaffolds in finely regulated microenvironments. Bioreactors enable precise control
				and
				monitoring of key biophysical regulatory factors ranging from oxygen tension to mechanical and
				electrical
				stimuli. We are developing bioreactor technologies with multi-parametric control to guide multi-lineage
				differentiation and spatially organized assembly of cells into functional tissue grafts.</p>
			<p><i>Tissue engineering bioreactors:</i> Skeletal muscle is a highly mechanically active tissue that exerts
				forces on the bony skeleton for movement and stabilization. Therefore, we study the impact of mimicking
				these mechanical strains in vitro on the contractility our engineered skeletal muscle tissue grafts.
				With
				our custom-designed strain bioreactors, we apply strains and electrical stimuli of varying amplitudes,
				frequencies, and durations to drive maturation and enhanced functionality of 3D skeletal muscle grafts.
			</p>
			<p><i>Transplant bioreactors:</i> Vascularized composite allotransplantation has increasingly become a
				viable
				clinical treatment option for the treatment of complex craniofacial and limb defects. However its
				potential
				is still limited by short preservation time. The ischemic injury occurred during clinical standard
				preservation leads to reperfusion injury and consequently exacerbates post-transplantation outcome. We
				work
				on mimicking normal physiological conditions after graft procurement to mitigate ischemia-reperfusion
				injuries.</p>

		<h3>Bone Regeneration</h3>
		<div class="research-topic">
			<p>Regenerative medicine approaches have the potential to revolutionize treatment methods for bone defects
				due to congenital abnormalities, trauma or cancer. The demands for each of these applications will vary
				in urgency, complexity of shape, and mechanical properties. Using imaging modalities in combination with
				subtractive and/or additive manufacturing technologies, we have developed methods to engineer
				anatomically shaped grafts that are customized to a patient’s needs. These structural considerations are
				combined with the development of novel biomaterials to regulate the biological and mechanical
				microenvironment. Ongoing studies focus on optimizing the integration of grafts with native tissues as
				well as addressing regulatory concerns in order to make biological orthopaedic prostheses a therapeutic
				reality.</p>
			<p><i>3D-printing technologies:</i> We have used both custom-built and commercially available 3D printers to
				engineer large, anatomically-shaped, biodegradable scaffolds for use in craniofacial bone regeneration.
				In ongoing studies, we are modifying the scaffold compositions to enhance their functionality and
				responsiveness to the regenerating bone tissues.</p>
			<p><i>Oxygen delivery:</i> The availability of oxygen can dictate the ability of stem cells to survive,
				proliferate, and differentiate. As such, our lab is developing methods to investigate how oxygen
				tensions affects stem cell function and developing tunable methods of oxygen delivery to improve bone
				regeneration in vivo.</p>
			<p><i>Pre-clinical models:</i> Our team has developed several pre-clinical models for assessing bone
				regeneration in vivo. These include sub-cutaneous models to evaluate bone formation and intramuscular
				defects to investigate vascular infiltration into scaffolds. We extensively utilize critical-sized
				calvarial defects in mice as a model of non-healing bone and utilize scaffolds encapsulating stem cells
				to study the biology of regeneration. In our on-going studies, we are investigating scale-up to defects
				of clinically-relevant sizes in larger animal models.</p>
			<p><i>Vascular imaging:</i> We are developing and implementing novel imaging platforms to investigate the
				correlation between vascularization and bone formation within engineered grafts following implantation
				into critical-sized murine calvarial defects. We are working closely with collaborators using live
				animal multi-modal optical imaging to evaluate blood flow and vessel maturity. Additionally, we are
				developing novel quantitative workflows to characterize the 3D vessel phenotype and spatial
				relationships between blood vessels and osteoprogenitors.</p>
